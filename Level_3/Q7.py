# Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists
# containing the names of students and their corresponding
# subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their
# respective subjects. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and
# dictionary comprehension.
# Input: [Sam, Alice, Mona] ,
# [Commerce, Science, Computer]
# Output: [Sam: Commerce, Alice: Science , Mona: Computer]
